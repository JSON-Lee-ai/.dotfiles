## this repo contains all of my dotfiles to be used with stow

installing GNU stow:

```bash
sudo pacman -S stow
```

remember to install this in $HOME so stow works correctly.
if you prefer to place this repo somewhere else you will have to
manually set the target each time like: ```stow -t DIR git```
